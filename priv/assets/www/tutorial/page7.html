<p>Congratulations - you just defined your first LFE function. Many more will follow!</p>

<p>
  <code>defun</code> takes the name of the function, then the list of arguments, and then the body of the function.
  Remember how an LFE program is made of lists?
  All the code in <code>defun</code> is a list, and the function body is also a list.
  (Even the arguments are collected in a list.)
</p>

<p>
  Oh, sorry for talking so long - you probably want to try out your brand new function!
  Type <code class="expr">(square 10)</code>.

  Hi there, hitchhiker!
</p>
<p>
 We're going to take a 10-minute ride through LFE ... Do you have your towel?
</p>
<p>
  You can type <code>next</code> to skip forward, <code>back</code> to return
  to the previous step, and <code>restart</code> to get back to the beginning.
  For more commands, type <code>help</code>.
</p>

<p>
  At any time you may wander off on your own, exploring any LFE code you'd
  like. Note, however, that some functionality has been removed from this
  REPL to safeguard the application space it's running in. If you would like
  to play with LFE in its full glory, see the links to the docs above for
  details on how to do so.
</p>
<p>
 Let's get started: type <code>next</code>.

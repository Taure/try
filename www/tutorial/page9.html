<p>
  Let's see what you just did: you evaluated a list where the first element is
  the function itself, defined on the spot - and the other elements are the
  arguments that you pass to the function.
  That's exactly the same syntax that you used earlier on to call functions
  like <code>square</code> or even <code>+</code>.
  The only difference is that now you defined the function in the same place
  where you called it.

<p>
   If you want, you can create a named function without using
   <code>defun</code>. Note, however, you can only do this in the REPL.
   Type <code class="expr">(set square (lambda (x) (* x x)))</code> to
   continue.

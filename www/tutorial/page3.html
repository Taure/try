  That was a strange way to say "three plus three", wasn't it?
</p>

<p>
  A LFE program is made of <em>lists</em>.
  <code class="expr">(+ 3 3)</code> is a list that contains an operator, and then the operands.
  Try out the same concept with the <code>*</code> and <code>-</code> operators.

<p>
  When you're ready to move forward, try some division: <code class="expr">(/ 10 3)</code>.
